## VENUE
The ceremony and party will all take place at Bay View, overlooking St Ouen's Bay. The easiest way to find the venue is using What.Three.Words: XXXXX
Please be aware that the ground is uneven so we recommend avoiding stiletto heels or having caps over them.

## CHILDREN
Children are welcome at our wedding ceremony and late afternoon celebrations, however due to limited seating, we ask children to be collected by 6:15pm.

## TRAVEL TO JERSEY
Regular flights are available from all London and most regional UK airports. The main airlines serving the Island are: British Airways | EasyJet | Logan Air. Alternatively, ferries are available from the south coast of England and north coast of France with DFDS.

## TRAVEL ON-ISLAND
It's handy having a car to explore Jersey but on the day of the wedding we recommend pre-booking taxis as vehicles are very restricted on site. 
 
## PLACES TO STAY
There are many options. Here are a few you might want to consider:
The Atlantic Hotel | L’Horizon Hotel & Spa | St Brelade’s Bay Hotel | Somerville Hotel | JOY Retreat (Glamping in a Yurt!) | Freedom holidays

## FRIDAY NIGHT & SUNDAY PLANS
We’re planning relaxed drinks on the Friday night and a beach BBQ on the Sunday, which we’d love you to join. Further details to follow.
